# emoji_party

This is intended as an example flutter project that demonstrates:

* Drag and drop items on the screen.
* Add, select and delete items
* Reorder the height of items

In terms of flutter features this means:

* Draggable and positional use of multiple widgets
* Passing a data model/class down to widgets
* Changing the data and updating widgets including Set_state()
* Object keys
* Some basic documentation.

This small project is a personal learning exercise. Feel free to fork and pull request for minor changes.

Feel free to make tutorial video based on this code. I won't change it much (although I still recommend you make your own fork). I'd be glad to hear about it.
