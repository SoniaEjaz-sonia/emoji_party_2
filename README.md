Adds group select and resizable widgets using gesture control.

## What is this project?
“Emoji party” is an open-source project that I am working on.

It is not intended to provide any direct value as an app or a game. (Although it would be funny if it turns into something like that).

All of the demonstrated functions in this repository are made freely available for other developers to use in their projects. As such all works in the Lib directory are licensed under creative commons CC0 1.0 Other files are generated by the flutter framework and associated plugins and packages are under whatever licenses are connected to those projects.

The project is a personal learning exercise, as well as, an easy-to-share project that demonstrates some functionality that I require in other private projects. This allows the occasional voluntary contributor or even a contractor to achieve some nice-to-have ideas, without any need for NDA’s, access rights, or red-tape. Hopefully this also contributes something to the open-source community.

Feel free to fork and pull request for minor changes. Happy to get feedback.

Feel free to fork and make your own video tutorials based on this code. No attribution is required.( But, I’m always glad to hear about it).
